Physical address is itself an actual address of a memory cell in the hardware. Virtual address 
is created from the viewpointt of a process: it is some abstract address which is used by the process
and therefore can be bigger than the actual physical memory at the device, since the virtual memory
assumes no other memory is allocated than those of the process.
